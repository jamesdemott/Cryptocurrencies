# Cryptocurrencies

### Overview, Purpose, Accomplishments
In this exercise, I took a static dataframe of cryptocurrency data including metrics about valuation, supply, transaction volume. I processed this data, removing null values and data which may have been unreliable. Finally I applied principal component analysis and reduced the dimensions of the data. 

Our result was a grouping of cryptocurrencies into 3 distinct categories which could be used to package the currencies for the purpose of an investment portfolio. Due to the unkown output, I used an unsupervised learning approach.
